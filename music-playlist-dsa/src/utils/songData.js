    lyrics: `Saturday mornin', jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you

Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man

Yeah (yeah)

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?`

    lyrics: `Just one more tear to cry
One teardrop from my eye
You better save it for
The middle of the night when things aren't right

Just one more tear to cry
One teardrop from my eye
You better save it for
The middle of the night when things aren't right

I gave everything I had to give
To make something of myself
And I was never the same again
After the end of beginning

Something's off inside
All the time
But I'm alright, I swear I'm fine`

Tu meri duaa, main tera khuda

Jab tak hai jaan, jab tak hai rooh
Tu rahegi har dum mere saath
Jab tak hai jaan, jab tak hai rooh
Tu rahegi har dum mere saath

Tere bin jeena kaise jeena
Tere bin marna kaise marna
Tu hi meri manzil, tu hi raasta
Tu meri duaa`

Chhod de saari duniyadaari

Tu kyun mann ko jalaye
Tum hi to ho jeene ki wajah
Tu kyun mann ko jalaye

Yeh ishq hai gunah toh
Mujhko yeh gunah karne de
Yeh ishq hai gunah toh
Mujhko yeh gunah karne de`

Love me, love me not
I need to know if you love me or love me not

I've been waiting for so long
To hear you say those three little words
Love me, love me not
Tell me now

Do you feel the same way too?
Or am I just a fool for you?
Love me, love me not
I need to know the truth`

Koi kisi se mile toh kya
Koi kisi ko chahe toh kya`
